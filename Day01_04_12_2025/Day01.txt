6. select the check box and click 'Yes i trust...'
7. open the package.json , change type to "module"

almost all the methods of playwright are async --> we use await

to use await keyword inside our own funciton, function must be declared as 'async'

how to run--> node demo1.js
code runner extension--> right click and select run code

by default browser will be invisible (headless mode)
demo1.js will just print the title 
----------------------------------
1. file extension will be .spec.js
2. we import browser and test from playwright
3. we can make the browser visible --> --headed

cmd---> npx playwright test demo2.spec.js --headed


when we use 'test' function of playwright it takes 2 arguments
1. title of the test
2. test script function 

the playwright test automatically , open the browser, open new page(tab) and send the page object --> {page} as argument for 'test script function '

{page}--> fixture


after the execution , it automatically closed the page and the browser


install the extension 'Playwright test for VS code'

restart playwright , we get run button next to test function

click run

to view the browser--> open playwright.config.js---> use{ headless:false,
